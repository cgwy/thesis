% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
 \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
 %\DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
 \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
 \graphicspath{{../}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
 \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/epslatex/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/


% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{float}
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
%\usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/dblfloatfix/

\begin{abstract}
In this paper, we apply machine learning and time series analysis to the problem of classifying and forecasting crime incidents in San Francisco. Our dataset originates from a Kaggle competition \cite{1}. Based on existing researches on these problems, we employ Logistic Regression and VAR(p) models respectively. The classification problem result demonstrates high challenge as our results across all the 39 crime categories achieved the accuracy of 32.67\%. For the time series analysis, we revealed correlations of occurrences of difference crime categories. And the VAR(p) model can forecast the trend of number of certain crimes. We also involved demographic data for classification problem, which contributed to a slight improvement to accuracy. With richer and more up-to-date data, our results might be further improved.

\section{Introduction}
Crime activities have always been threat to public safety, and researches on criminals have long been limited within the realm social science. With the huge volume of existing crime datasets and the advent of robust machine learning and statistical technologies, we seek to predictively analyze crime incidents. Our vision is to help police, public policy makers as well as individuals understand crime patterns and take more effective measures to prevent crimes.

In our project, we combined spatio-temporal and demographic data to predict which category of crime has the largest possibility to occur, given a timestamp, location and demographics of the surrounding area. The inputs to our classification algorithm include time (hour, day, year), location(street, latitude, longitude and police district) and demographic data(population density, median house value, poverty rate and median per capita income). The output is the type of crime that  is most likely to have occurred. We performed complicated feature engineering to enrich predictors. We also tried various classification algorithms, among which Logistic Regression achieved highest accuracy.

For time series analysis, we  applied vector autogression model to capture the interdependencies among multiple categories of crime time series. We tested for the optimal lag $p$ for VAR(p) model. The input to VAR(p) is spatio-temporal data; the output is the time series model. For some crime categories, this model can reveal the trends of its occurrence.

\section{Datasets}
Our primary dataset is a training set obtained from Kaggle, which includes 878,049 crimes in San francisco that occurred from 2003 to 2015. Every crime record was marked a category, and there are in total 39 categories. The other dataset is the demographic data of different neighborhoods in San Francisco, including population, income, race constitution, education level etc. The demographic data is provided by US Census conducted in 2010. We also searched Wikipedia for population density. 
\subsection{Features}
Each record in our dataset correspond to a particular crime incident, which includes following fields:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Date and timestamp of the crime
  \item Category of the crime. Which is the label to be predicted in test data set.
  \item Detailed description of the crime (only provided in train data)
  \item Day of the week of the incident
  \item Name of the Police Department District the took charge of the crime.
  \item Resolution, which means how the crime was resolved(booked, arrested or resolved, etc)
  \item Approximate street address of the crime
  \item Longitude
  \item Latitude
\end{itemize}
Among these fields, resolution is discarded as it only exist in train data.
\subsection{Preprocessing}
While \url{http://datasf.org} also includes similar data, our dataset from Kaggle is more selected as there is no empty cell in any fields. However, some fields contain unreasonable values due to probably wrong registration. Some numeric fields need to be scaled while some fields are not yet numeric. To transform the original data to suitable input of classification algorithms, we performed feature engineering described below.
\subsubsection{Outlier removal}
The following pictures are scatter plots of scaled longitude(X) and latitude(Y). There are in total 67 outlier points, all of their latitudes are beyond the border of San Francisco. After removal of these outliers, the scatter plot fits the territory of San Francisco.
\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics [width=0.48\textwidth]{pics/outliers.png}
\caption{Scatter plot of crime locations before and after outlier removal}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Demographic data}
Our demographic data is based on US Census from 2006 to 2010. It includes demographic data in each neighborhood of San Francisco, covering race, education, income and housing characteristics. Following heat displayed the correlation among the frequency of some typical crime categories and demographic statistics. For example, poverty rate is positively correlated to most crime categories, especially embezzlement; while high population density tend to relate to drug use and disorderly conduct.

One challenge of employing demographic data is correctly matching it the the crime location as the crime dataset does not include neighborhood. Our solution was to download the map data of San Francisco, where each neighborhood is represented as a polygon. Following pseudo-code shows how we located each neighborhood.
\begin{lstlisting}
bool getNeighborhood(Lang, Lat, Polygon){ 
	//For acceleration
	if (Lang, Lat) in Polygon-Bounding-Box{
		if (Lang, Lat) in Polygon{
			return True
		}
	}
	return False
}
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics [width=0.48\textwidth]{pics/nh_category_corr.png}
\caption{heat map of correlation among crime amount and demographic data}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Feature enrichment}
For timestamps in dataset, we parsed the month\/date-of-year, hour-of-day from them. We also added season, day/night as new fields.

Another feature enrichment approach is computing the log-odds defined below, where c is crime category.
$$logodds\_c = log(\frac{c\_counts}{len(train\_data)}) - log(1 - \frac{c\_counts}{len(train\_data)})$$\\ There are around 23,000 addresses in the train dataset, which is small compared with number of crime entries. 

\subsubsection{Scaling and Transformation}
Some fields are skewed, with log transformation their distribution are more close to Gaussian Distribution. Following figure shows the log transformation of percapita-income. Similar transformations are performed on median-rent and population density.

\section{Methods}
\subsection{Naive Bayes}
\subsection{Logistic Regression}
\subsection{Random Forest}
\subsection{Adaboost }
\subsection{Time Series}
A time series is a sequence of data points with continuous time interval and successive measurements made over a time interval. Time series analysis comprises approaches for extracting meaningful statistics and other characteristics of the data. And time series forecasting is using a model to predict future values based on previously recorded data. It has been applied to crime analysis for decades \cite{2}.

VAR models (vector autoregressive models) are desiged for multivariate time series. It view each variable as a linear combination of past lags of itself and past lags of other variables. The variables(number of crimes in our case) are collected in a 39*1 vector. At time $t$, define the vector as $y_t$, a  $p$-th order VAR, namely VAR(p), is $$y_t = c + A_1y_{t-1} + A_2y_{t-2} + ... A_py_{t-p} + e_t$$ where $y_{t-j}$ is called the $j-th$ lag of y, c is constant intercept and $e_t$ is an error term. The VAR model assumes the data is \textbf{weakly stationary} and above attributes of $e_t$ must hold
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $E(e_t) = 0$, zero mean error
	\item $E(e_t{e_t}') = \Omega$, the contemporaneous covariance matrix of $e_t$ is positive semidefinite.
	\item $E(e_t{e_{t-k}}') = 0$, for any positive k. There is no series correlation in error term.
\end{enumerate}
An Augmented Dickey-Fuller unit root test \cite{3} is often employ to test stationarity.  Using the library from statsmodel \cite{4} , we performed the ADF test on each category with constant, linear and quadratic trend.  We chose BIC(Bayesian Information Criterion) for penalty strictness. (results in Fig 1). There are 23 categories with scores below 5\% level, and we selected these categories for time series model construction.

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics [width=0.48\textwidth]{pics/adf_test.png}
\caption{ADF test score against 5\% and 10\% threshold }
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\section{Experiments}
\subsection{Time Series}
\subsubsection{Motivations}
Based on the stationarity test in previous chapter, the VAR{p} model is suitable for finding trends in the crime dataset. We selected 28 categories with low ADF score, and computed the pair-wise correlation among them. Following picture shows the heat-map of correlation matrix which computes the Pearson's r. In the heat-map, we can find large positively correlation coefficients, for example, BURGLARY \& ASSAULT, as well as negative coefficients like DRIVING UNDER THE INFLUENCE \& VEHICLE THEFT.
\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics [width=0.48\textwidth]{pics/heat_map_time_series.png}
\caption{Heatmap of time series correlation matrix }
\end{center}
\end{figure}
Auto-correlation function(ACF) and Cross-correlation function(CCF) are also effective approaches to reveal statistical connections. Following picture demonstrate the CCF between category 'DRIVING UNDER THE INFLUENCE' and 'VEHICLE THEFT'. The increase of the first category precedes the decrease of the other. These kinds of correlations are further exploited in the correlation matrix.
\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics [width=0.48\textwidth]{pics/ccf_DRIVING_UNDER_THE_INFLUENCE_VEHICLE_THEFT.png}
\caption{CCF between 'DRIVING UNDER THE INFLUENCE' and 'VEHICLE THEFT'}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Model Selection}
Choosing the order $p$ for VAR(p) model is a feature selection problem. We tried different values of $p$ under two penalty criterions AIC(Akaike Information Criterion) and BIC. As is shown in following picture, with AIC, the penalty score is minimal when $p=2$. For BIC, the penalty is 30.88 at $p=1$ and 30.89 at $p=2$.
\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics [width=0.48\textwidth]{pics/aic_bic.png}
\caption{aic/bic}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Fitting Model}
We choose $p=2$ and AIC penalty criterion for VAR(p) model fitting. And tried the model on "ASSAULT" time series. The first 40 time units were used for fitting, and the last 10 were forecasted. As the following picture shows, the model is not able to capture the exact quarterly variation, but it predicts the trend of increase or decrease in crime number.
\begin{figure}%[H]
